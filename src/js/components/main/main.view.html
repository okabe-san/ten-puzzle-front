      There are 4 digits numbers and operetors. You need to use all 4 digits and operators to get "10". Calculation happens always letf to right. Use "()" if you need them (to change calculation order).
      For example; <br>
      2 + 2 * 2 + 2 = 10 <br>
      Becuae 2 + 2 = 4, 4 * 2 = 8, 8 + 2 = 10 <br>
      If use (), it will be 2 + (2 * 2) + 2 = 8 <br>
      Because 2 * 2 = 4, 2 + 4 = 6, 6 + 2 = 8
